Hi! This is a tiny script that allow you to changue between two Gnome GTK themes quickly and easily.
This is very useful to switch to dark theme at night.

Themes defined by default are Adwaita and Adwaita-dark but you can select your themes editing the config section of gnome-theme-switcher.sh
I suggest link this script to keyboard shortcut or add it to cron to automate the switch.
#### Remember to give execution permissises to the script!
